# Scientific-Tools-Hobbies

Hi random internet user,

This is just a place for a nerdy grad student to upload things I thought other other people in the scientific community might find useful. I created the code here myself to help with things related to my thesis work, or just because I thought it'd be a fun project. I'm not a coder by training and this is primarily a hobby so I apologize in advance for any clunkiness/lack of user-friendliness. I'm always open to advice for improvement! I hope there's something here you find helpful or interesting!

Happy coding!
